You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

   Load `.specify/templates/ignore-patterns.md` for the per-technology and per-tool pattern lists when generating or verifying ignore files.

5. **Decision Record Gate (Principle VII — NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:

   Before executing any tasks, scan the loaded artifacts for evidence of architectural decisions not yet recorded:
   - List all `ADR_NNN_*.md` and `LOG_NNN_*.md` files present in `.specify/memory/`
   - Identify any decisions in plan.md, research.md, or tasks.md (e.g., technology choices, integration patterns, data-model approaches, third-party services) that lack a corresponding ADR file
   - **If missing ADRs are found**: Output a CRITICAL block and **STOP**:
     ```
     🚨 CRITICAL — Decision Record Gate Failed (Principle VII)
     The following architectural decisions have no ADR file in .specify/memory/:
       - [decision description] — referenced in [plan.md / tasks.md]

     Implementation cannot proceed until ADR files exist for each decision above.
     Create the missing ADR files (use .specify/templates/adr-template.md) and add
     back-references in the relevant spec/plan before re-running /speckit.implement.
     ```
   - **If all decisions are covered**: proceed to step 6.

   **During implementation** (step 7): If executing a task reveals a new architectural decision not anticipated in planning (e.g., choosing between two libraries, adopting a design pattern, changing a data contract), **STOP that task**, create the appropriate ADR or LOG file, update the cross-reference in plan.md or spec.md, then resume. Do not defer decision recording to after implementation.

6. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

7. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

8. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Write failing tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios before writing any implementation. Confirm each test fails for the right reason before proceeding to implement.
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

9. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.
   - **COMMIT AT EACH PHASE CHECKPOINT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: After all tasks in a phase are complete and the phase checkpoint is verified, stage only the files modified or created during that phase's tasks using `git add <file1> <file2> ...` (never `git add -A`), then commit. Use conventional commit format: `feat(NNN): [phase name] — [checkpoint description]` where NNN is the feature number and the description comes from the Checkpoint line in tasks.md. Do not batch multiple phase checkpoints into one commit. This produces granular local history that can be squashed pre-push.

10. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.
